# Odin Youtube Copy

This is a project to show everything I've learned and applying it by recreating a site I constantly use. That site being youtube.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Work Left

***

#### High Priority

##### Upload Video

- need to finish out css

***

##### All Links

- change out from useNavigate to Links

***

##### Watch Page

- add title 
- add videos user info
- add likes dislikes for both the video and comments
- add share button
- possibly add a report button
- add edit button on own videos
- add description with with views and time
- add 1 view to the video on page view
- maybe add comment sort
- put elipsis button on right end of the comment for own users comments to give option to delete or edit

***

##### Video Player

- put thumbnail in place
- add images to the timeline
- remove cc
- have volume stay extended until cursor leaves video player
- add title in full screen
- video controls fade out after a few seconds with the cursor
- figure out how to keep scrubbing image within the video player
- maybe decouple the video player into its own component to spread it across the website

***

#### Medium Priority

##### Channel Page

- let users set a channel description
- let users delete or edit their own videos info
- playlist is a maybe
- if no playlist add a likes tab
- give functionality to channel tabs
- on home page maybe add 3 lines of recent uploads, most viewed, and most liked 
- on videos tab have buttons to sort by latest(default) popular(maybe split this into most likes and most views) oldest 
- don't perceive value in community tab probably wont make it
- not possible to replicate youtubes customize channel without making a shoddier version or outright adding months to the project

***

##### Navbar

- open hamburger menu
- create an actual home button
- send onSubmit for the searchbar to send to the search page (which doesn't exist yet)
- remove text to speach unless a free api exist 

***

##### Hamburger Menu

- without a subscription system this will be useless aside from mobile use
- create home button
- subscribtions button if I can create subscriptions

***

#### Low Priority

##### Content Containers 

- use position to impose channel links over img and user
- on hover shuffle through scrub images

***

##### Notifcations

- to expensive to actually implement on the front end side and with no real backend this will most likely be removed

***

##### Search Page

- low priority

***

##### Light Mode

- lowest priority
